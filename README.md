# Hacker Room
Hacker Room is a Chrome Extension that extends the functionality of Github's editing feature to be collaborative with anyone else on the page. Furthermore, Hacker Room has a chat feature such that collaborators can communicate. Though this extension placed top 15 at MHack Fall 2014, this extension is still rather crude and requires refinement before garnering actual use.

# Installation
In order to install Hacker Room simply clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jonostap/HackerRoom
```
Then, open Google Chrome and navigate to the "Tools > Extensions" menu:

Check the "Developer Mode" checkbox in the top-right of the screen. Then, click the "Load unpacked extension" button. After that, select the freshly cloned repository folder for HackerRoom and click "OK". You should now have HackerRoom installed.

# Usage
Navigate to an editing page for a file on Github (e.g. https://github.com/jonostap/HackerRoom/edit/master/README.md), you'll notice that instead of the ordinary ace editor you would normall see, you'll see a supercharged collaborative one powered by firebase.
